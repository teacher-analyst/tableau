# Tableau
This project is part of Module 18 Challenge of the Monash University Data Analytics Bootcamp. 

## Project Description
### Problem
Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilisation. Each month, bike data is collected, organised, and made public on the Citi Bike DataLinks to an external site. webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

### Deliverables
1. Design 2–5 visualisations for each discovered phenomenon (4–10 total).
2. Use your visualisations (not necessarily all of them) to design a dashboard for each phenomenon. The dashboards should be accompanied by an analysis explaining why the phenomenon may be occurring.
3. Create a static or dynamic map that plots all bike stations.
4. Create your final presentation in Tableau in the form of dashboards and stories.

## Analysis 

The following analysis is about citibike data that was collected from May to July in 2023 in Jersey City. The data does inlude some bike stations located in New York City due to bike journeys crossing the Hudson River and ending the journey in New York City. 

### Dashboards & Maps
The first dashboard, Starting the Journey, displays information about starting the bike journey in Jersey City. Just under 300, 000 trips were taken between May and July and the average distance travelled was 0.73 miles. 
The top 10 bike stations to begin a journey are located in suburbs along the length of the Hudson river with zip codes 07302, 07310 and 07030. All of these stations except two have a higher usage by members. '12 St and Sinatra Dr' and 'South Waterfront Walkway' are predominantly used by casual users. According to unitedstateszipcodes.org, the demographic of these zicodes are people aged in their late 20s to early 40s while an extremely small number are middle aged adults. These people are mainly single with a small number of families. The median household income in these three suburbs is between $98000 and $133000 USD.
The least popular stations are located in suburbs 07304, 07306, 07307, 07087 and 07310. Each of these stations have a count of 1 trip. The age of the people living in these zipcodes is the same as the those living in zipcodes of the top 10 stations. The main noticeable difference (except for zipcode 07310) is the median household income, being between $40000 - $480000 USD.
