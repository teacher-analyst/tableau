This project is part of Module 18 Challenge of the Monash University Data Analytics Bootcamp. 

## Project Description
### Problem
Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilisation. Each month, bike data is collected, organised, and made public on the Citi Bike DataLinks to an external site. webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

### Deliverables
1. Design 2–5 visualisations for each discovered phenomenon (4–10 total).
2. Use your visualisations (not necessarily all of them) to design a dashboard for each phenomenon. The dashboards should be accompanied by an analysis explaining why the phenomenon may be occurring.
3. Create a static or dynamic map that plots all bike stations.
4. Create your final presentation in Tableau in the form of dashboards and stories.
